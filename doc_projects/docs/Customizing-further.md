You can adjust many settings within the Data folder of the toolkit.

Keep in mind that updates to the package will overwrite you custom settings. To avoid this, copy the required settings files into your own folder, rename it, and then drag it into the appropriate field. This will ensure it won't be overridden.

The package is provided open source, so you can make any modifications you like. If you notice a missing feature, or write something other people might use, consider letting us know in the issues page so we can add it to the package to be enjoyed by everyone.
