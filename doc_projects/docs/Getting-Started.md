The best place to start is by completing the TutorialExperiment Tutorial, which should guide you through the basics of how to use the toolkit. 

Tutorials are in the documentation folder of the GitHub Repository
* [TutorialExperiment](TutorialExperiment): Creating your first experiment (Start here)
* Advanced tutorials coming soon.

Also check out the SampleSimpleExperiment located in the main framework folder. There is a sample scene with a very basic experiment set up.

[Download the latest Release](https://github.com/BioMotionLab/ExperimentalFramework/releases).
