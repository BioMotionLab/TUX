In the Extras folder inside the main toolkit folder, there are some useful tools that might be useful for running experiments. They are provided “as is” and are not documented. These tools were created to solve common problems in our own experiments that we thought might be of use to others.
Here is a brief list of the extras

### BlackScreenFlasher 

this tool presents a black screen to the camera or VR headset for a specified time. 

This might be useful for for experiments where you’d like to present a blank delay between two stimuli.

### Instructions

This is a very simple tool for displaying instructions to participants.
