title: Using Standalone VR Headsets
---

bmlTUX is compatible with standalone VR Headsets, several users have successfully used them in conjunction with bmlTUX. But using standalone headsets presents a few extra challenges compared to tethered headsets.

Unfortunately, We, the developers do not have access to these headsets and therefore can not test them very well. This page is a repository of potentially useful information from other users to help with setting up bmlTUX for standalone headsets.
