# The BiomotionLab (BML) Experiment Toolkit

## An experimental framework for experiments in Unity

The BML Experiment Toolkit helps you design and run experiments in Unity quickly and iteratively without fussing over coding details. You define your variables and experiment structure, and the toolkit will automatically create a table of trials to run. You can customize what happens before, during, and after a trial, block of trials, or the experiment itself, while not having to worry about the details of setting up and running your experiment. You configure an experimental design, write custom behavior and functionality, and then the toolkit will automatically construct your experiment, create and run all required trials, and outputs the results to a file.
